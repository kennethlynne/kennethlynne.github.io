This component wraps up [React Select](https://react-select.com) for use in Framer X. Original component by [@JedWatson](https://twitter.com/JedWatson), Framer component by [@steveruizok](https://twitter.com/steveruizok). 

# What’s the same

This component accepts all of React Select’s regular [props](https://react-select.com/props). **Everything you can do with React Select, you should be able to do with this component** through overrides. If you’re advanced enough to find its limits, you’re probably better off using the actual component.

# What’s different

This component accepts all of React Select’s regular [props](https://react-select.com/props), which are deep and many. It also accepts several custom props:

- **cOptions**: an array of strings that the component will turn into React Select’s regular options
- **cDefaultValue**: a string that the component will turn into one of React Select’s regular options

## Example Overrides:

```
import { Data, Override } from "framer"

const data = Data({
    selected: null
})

export const SelectOverride: Override = () => {
    return {
        onChange: (option, action) => {
            data.selected = option.value
            // console.log(option, action)
        },
    }
}
```
